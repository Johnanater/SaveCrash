SaveCrash will automatically try saving the server when it starts.
If the save is unsuccessful, then it'll automatically shutdown the server.

It's meant for errors like [these](https://github.com/SmartlyDressedGames/Unturned-3.x-Community/issues/390) (which is still a rare issue),
which a simple restart will fix.

---

**Installation:**

1. Download SaveCrash.dll and place it in your plugins folder
2. Restart the server
4. Fill out the config and restart the server again
5. Enjoy!
